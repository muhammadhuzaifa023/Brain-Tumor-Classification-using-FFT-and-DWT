# Brain-Tumor-Classification-using-FFT-and-DWT
This repository presents a **Brain Tumor Classification System** that classifies MRI images into four types of tumors â€” *Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary*, and *Normal* â€” using advanced **image processing** and **machine learning** techniques.  
The project leverages **Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)**, **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**, **GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix)**, and **LBP (Local Binary Pattern)** for hybrid feature extraction, combined with a **PyTorch-based Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** classifier for high accuracy.
