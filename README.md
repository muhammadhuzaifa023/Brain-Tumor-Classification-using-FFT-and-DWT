# Brain-Tumor-Classification-using-FFT-and-DWT
Brain Tumor Classification using FFT, DWT, GLCM, and LBP with Machine Learning and Deep Learning (PyTorch). This project extracts hybrid texture and frequency features from MRI images to classify brain tumors (glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and normal) using advanced feature fusion and deep neural networks.
